# Cognitive Empowerment Implementation

This document provides detailed information about the implementation of the Cognitive Empowerment training system based on the usage scenarios provided in the flowchart.

## Implementation Structure

The project is structured as a full-stack web application with the following components:

### Backend (Node.js/Express)

The backend provides a RESTful API with the following modules:

1. **User Management:** Registration, authentication, and profile management.
2. **Training Exercises:** API endpoints for each cognitive training category.
3. **Progress Tracking:** Record and analyze user progress.
4. **AI Integration:** Integration with AI models for personalized exercises and feedback.

### Frontend (React)

The frontend is a responsive web application with the following key features:

1. **Dashboard:** Overview of all cognitive training categories.
2. **Training Modules:**
   - Memory Training (Family Photo Recall)
   - Attention Training (Find the Hidden Objects)
   - Executive Function Training (Daily Schedule Organizer)
   - Language Ability Training (Word Puzzle and Proverbs)
   - Logic and Reasoning Training (Classic Board Games)
   - Emotion Regulation Training (Guided Relaxation Exercises)
3. **Progress Tracking:** Visualizations of user performance across categories.
4. **User Authentication:** Login and registration functionality.

### AI Integration

The system uses several AI models for different cognitive training aspects:

1. **Memory Training:** 
   - Uses retrieval-augmented generation to create personalized memory exercises.
   - Adapts difficulty based on user performance.

2. **Attention Training:**
   - Uses object detection algorithms to generate "Find the Hidden Objects" exercises.
   - Utilizes attention mechanisms to model and improve user focus.

3. **Executive Function Training:**
   - Uses planning models to create challenges in the "Daily Schedule Organizer."
   - Reinforcement learning to adapt complexity based on user skills.

4. **Language Ability Training:**
   - Transformer models (like BERT) for vocabulary and language understanding.
   - NLP for generating context-appropriate word puzzles.

5. **Logic and Reasoning Training:**
   - Graph neural networks for planning and reasoning tasks.
   - Decision trees to generate adaptive puzzles.

6. **Emotion Regulation Training:**
   - Sentiment analysis to detect user emotions.
   - Affective computing to provide appropriate feedback.

  4. Post-game analysis of decisions and alternatives

### Emotion Regulation Training: "Guided Relaxation Exercises"

- **Implementation:** Chatbot with mood detection and guided exercises.
- **AI Features:**
  - Sentiment analysis from user responses
  - Personalized relaxation techniques based on detected mood
  - Progress tracking of emotional regulation improvement
- **User Flow:**
  1. System engages user in conversation to detect mood
  2. Appropriate relaxation exercise is suggested
  3. User follows guided meditation or breathing exercises
  4. Follow-up to measure effectiveness and improvement
