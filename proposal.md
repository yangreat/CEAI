1.	Proposed Title: Cognitive Empowerment: AI-Driven Training System for Enhancing Brain Health Across All Ages

3.	Objectives:
The objective of this proposal is the development of a state-of-the-art cognitive training system that tries to improve the brain health of cognitively impaired groups with personalized, AI-driven exercises. Priority has to be given to cognitive domains that allow collaboration on memorization, attention, executive functions, language, and social skills. By applying state-of-the-art technologies, it will include deep learning like Multimodal Large Language Model (LLMs), augmented reality, and cloud computing, offering intuitive, engaging, and accessible experiences that make sure of cognitive improvement and emotional wellbeing. It shall enable elderly users to personalize, receive feedback, 

be socially connected and have fun through gamified experiences in a private and secure manner with cross-platform compatibility.


4.	Capstone Proposal
Background
Cognitive decline seriously affects the life qualities of aged and disabled people, having taken away their autonomy and alienated them from society. Cognitive disorders are a category of diseases affecting cognitive functions such as thinking, memory, attention, comprehension and judgment, language, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, cerebrovascular cognitive impairment resulting from various factors. The development is irreversible and progressive. Although there are no drugs that can completely cure the disease, if one is diagnosed early and intervention starts early, the decline of cognitive functions can be slowed down, and cognitive training has been proved an effective means to relieve the progress of the disease.

The Census and Statistics Department (2023) provides detailed statistical data on household income and wealth in Hong Kong, which refers that “the proportion of elderly persons aged 65 and over is projected to increase from 20.5% in 2021 to 36.0% in 2046”. It is, therefore, high time that, in the context of the aging population of the Hong Kong and the rising prevalence of neurodegenerative disorders, solutions are not being developed, made accessible or scaled up. The cognitive training systems enabled through continuous improvement of state-of-the-art AI (such as the multimodal large language model-LLM) and interactive technologies show considerable promise in offering improved memory, attention, and executive function, among the other key cognitive abilities.


Problem Formulation
Specific Needs of People with Disability or Elderly: Most cognitive training tools are not personalized for accessibility and are not very inclusive, especially to elderly users or users with disabilities.
Technological Gaps: Most of the existing systems lack modern AI capabilities related to speech recognition, deep learning, and multimodal training, which would substantially improve the outcomes.
Engagement and Usability: Current solutions often lack engaging interfaces, reducing user adherence. To enhance stickiness, we propose adding personalized feedback and sharing. These additions will foster a sense of community, excitement, and progress, thereby improving user adherence and effectiveness.
Scalianbility and Accessibility: Most tools for cognitive training require expensive hardware or even professional guidance; this makes them unreachable by the underprivileged.

Furthermore, there is presently a great deal of reliance clinically on either carers or therapists operating cognitive training independently, or via software-driven digital therapies. While the former requires a lot of manpower and is rather expensive, thus pressuring the caregivers seriously, the latter sometimes looks just like 

a standard test, which has little flexibility: patients can only answer some pre-set puzzles, far from the memory training for improving cognitive performance. Current digital therapies also lack the ease, interactivity, and intuitiveness that software applications currently have, which seriously affects adherence, or the behavior a 


patient exhibits in following medical advice. For patients with cognitive impairment, continuous training has the effect of alleviating symptoms.


Project Significance
The idea of this project was born with the aim of overcoming these drawbacks by developing a powerful AI-driven cognitive training system. Its great potential lies in its ability to:
Improve the Quality of Life: This will facilitate improvement in cognitive and emotional functioning, thus helping users in living a fuller and independent life.
Bridge Accessibility Gaps: Bridge gaps in accessibility by using mobile and web-based platforms to reach out to a heterogeneous group, including underserved populations.
Lead the Wave of Innovation in Healthcare: Chart the future for AI-driven cognitive health solutions.
Empower Caregivers: Provides actionable insights on a user's cognitive and emotional health to guardians and caregivers of elderly users or those with disabilities.


Innovative Features
Personalized Training Programs: Adaptive difficulty using reinforcement learning based on user performance.
Multimodal Interactions: Utilize text, speech, and augmented reality (AR) for immersive and engaging experiences.
Cloud-Edge Hybrid Architecture: Optimize responsiveness and computational efficiency.

Comprehensive Cognitive Modules: Cover memory, attention, language, visuospatial, social, sensory, and emotional training.
Ethical AI Integration: Incorporate transparency and data privacy measures.
Community Integration: Foster social connections through group activities and collaborative tasks, with innovative additions such as personalized training result feedback and sharing, training battles for friendly competition, and team training to enhance camaraderie and mutual support. These features not only promote social integration but also add layers of engagement and motivation, setting our solution apart from traditional cognitive training platforms.


Ethical Concerns

Data Privacy: The application shall provide for secure encryption of data and shall abide by set regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA in handling sensitive user information.
Accessibility: Design user interfaces considering a wide range of disabilities, such as visual, auditory, and motor.
Biases in AI: Train the AI models on various datasets to avoid any cultural or demographic bias.

Emotional Sensitivity: Handle emotional data with care so as to avoid misinterpretation or adverse impacts on users.


Applicability
The system will benefit:
Elderly Individuals: Mitigate age-related cognitive decline and promote independence.
People with Disabilities: Enhance daily cognitive functioning and social integration.
Healthcare Providers: Offer data-driven insights to inform care strategies.
Caregivers: Provide tools for monitoring and supporting loved ones.


Methodology
Lets talk about the Functions and Attributes. In our cognitive training system, we use a lot of deep learning technologies in backend, such as the newest Large Language Model. Also, we choose the best way to deploy those models to interact with users. For details, the way each cognition training section is deployed, the deep learning models used, and the inference is shown below flowchart Fig1:

 
Fig1. Flowchart for the Functions and Attributes


It is important to note that the models used under the “Deep Learning Models” node can be used to include generating material and answers for cognitive training, as well as understanding the information input, information output and decision-making processes that occur when interacting with a user. And for the training or inferencing, we plan to use some cutting edge tricks to improve accuracy, like Mixture of Experts Explained (MoE), Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and AI Agent Design. 

Based on the design of the functions, we propose some use cases which is shown below:

Besides, we also propose some product extensions:
